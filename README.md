# CUDA Parallel Programming in CNN
1. Created both CPU and GPU implementations of the neural-network convolution layer forward pass.
2. Accelerated the GPU implementation by 40\% with multiple optimizations (atomic operations, matrix unrolling etc.).
3. Used NVIDIA Visual Profiler to analyze performance of the optimizations.
